<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of trapDetect is to provide the functionality to simulate the
spread of individuals over a given area (such as an orchard or block),
and provide the tools to determine the probability of detecting a pest
using various detection functions.

## Installation

You can install trapDetect from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dangladish/trapDetect")
```

Please note that trapDetect is in early development and likely will
change significantly.

## The main function: calc\_escape\_prob()

The main function is `calc_escape_prob()` which simulates the spread of
a population of individuals using the `sim_spread()` function if not
provided, and then determines the probability of detecting an individual
for a given trap configuration using `p_detect_one()`. There are a
number of optional arguments in `calc_escape_prob()` which the user can
set for their own purposes. A basic example can be run using the
following code:

``` r
library(trapDetect)
calc_escape_prob()
#> [1] "Warning: generating survey and raster..."
#> [1] "No initial data detected, generating random simulations"
#> $mean_prob
#>  [1] 0.001836979 0.002746483 0.003712301 0.005051335 0.007295962 0.009514235
#>  [7] 0.010214633 0.011241861 0.017856956 0.034626102 0.036966920
```
