# trapDetect

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of trapDetect is to provide the functionality to simulate the
spread of individuals over a given area (such as an orchard or block),
and provide the tools to determine the probabilty of detecting a pest
using various detection functions.

## Installation

You can install trapDetect from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dangladish/trapDetect")
```

Please note that trapDetect is in early development and likely will
change significantly.

## The main function: calc\_escape\_prob()

The main function is `calc_escape_prob()` which simulates the spread of
a population of individuals using the `sim_spread()` function if not
provided, and then determines the probability of detecting an individual
for a given trap configuration using `p_detect_one()`. There are a
number of optional arguments in `calc_escape_prob()` which the user can
set for their own purposes. A basic exmaple can be run using the
following code:

``` r
library(trapDetect)
calc_escape_prob()
#> [1] "Warning: generating survey and raster..."
#> [1] "No initial data detected, generating random simulations"
#> $mean_prob
#>  [1] 0.002087883 0.010622804 0.023414164 0.025484057 0.026623200 0.027987658
#>  [7] 0.030212210 0.030801545 0.032711044 0.033302982 0.034511957
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
