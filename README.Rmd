# trapDetect

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of trapDetect is to provide the functionality to simulate the spread of individuals over a given area (such as an orchard or block), and provide the tools to determine the probabilty of detecting a pest using various detection functions.  

## Installation

You can install trapDetect from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dangladish/trapDetect")
```

Please note that trapDetect is in early development and likely will change significantly.

## The main function: calc_escape_prob()

The main function is `calc_escape_prob()` which simulates the spread of a population of individuals using the `sim_spread()` function if not provided, and then determines the probability of detecting an individual for a given trap configuration using `p_detect_one()`.  There are a number of optional arguments in `calc_escape_prob()` which the user can set for their own purposes.  A basic exmaple can be run using the following code:

```{r example}
library(trapDetect)
calc_escape_prob()
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:


You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
